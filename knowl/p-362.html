<p>This is the same problem we discussed in <a href="sec_nchoosek.html" class="xref" alt="Section 2.6 The number of subsets of a given size" title="Section 2.6 The number of subsets of a given size">Section 2.6</a>. Finally, consider the last case: choose 5 balls out of 90 such that repetition is allowed, and the order does not count. We claim that this is the same problem as 90 pirates distributing 5 gold pieces among themselves (<a href="sec_money.html" class="xref" alt="Section 2.7 Distributing money" title="Section 2.7 Distributing money">Section 2.7</a>). Indeed, for every gold distribution we can consider to choose those balls which have the same number as the pirates who received gold pieces, exactly as many times as the number of gold pieces they received. For example, if the first pirate received 3 gold pieces and the tenth pirate received two, this corresponds to choosing the numbers \(1, 1, 1, 10, 10\text{.}\) Similarly, for every choice of numbers we have a distribution: a pirate gets as many gold pieces as the number of times its corresponding ball has been chosen. Thus, by <a knowl="./knowl/thm_pirates.html" knowl-id="xref-thm_pirates" alt="Theorem 2.7.10 " title="Theorem 2.7.10 ">Theorem 2.7.10</a> the number of possibilities to choose 5 numbers out of 90 if repetition is allowed and the order does not count is</p>
\begin{equation*}
\binom{90+5-1}{90-1} = \binom{90+5-1}{5}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
