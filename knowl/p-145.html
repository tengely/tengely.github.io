<p>Now, this was easy, but this party is very big, and a lot of people attend it. Say, there are 200 College freshmen greeting each other by shaking hands. How many handshakes are there? We can try to generalize our former argument. Let us count the number of handshakes by ordering the people in some way (say, by date of birth). That is, first we count the handshakes by the oldest person, then the handshakes by the second oldest person, etc. The oldest person shakes hand with 199 other people, this is 199 handshakes. The second oldest person shakes hand with 199 people, as well, but we have already counted 1 handshake with the oldest person. That is, we count 198 more handshakes. For the third oldest person, out of 199 handshakes we have already counted 2: one with the oldest person and one with the second oldest person. That is, we count 197 more handshakes, etc. Continuing this argument, we count one less handshakes with each person. For the second youngest people we count only one new handshake: the handshake with the youngest person. And finally, for the youngest person we have already counted all handshakes. That is, the number of handshakes is</p>
\begin{equation*}
199 + 198 + 197 + \dots + 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
