<p>Let us denote by \(T_n\) the minimum number of moves that will transfer \(n\) disks from peg \(A\) to peg \(C\text{.}\) Since no moves are needed to transfer \(n=0\) disks, we have that \(T_0=0\text{,}\) and the previous two examples show that \(T_1=1\) and \(T_2=3\text{.}\) Let us prove that \(T_n\leq 2T_{n-1}+1\text{,}\) that is, there is a solution with \(2T_{n-1}+1\) moves. In \(T_{n-1}\) moves we can transfer the \(n-1\) smaller disks from peg \(A\) to peg \(B\text{.}\) We move the largest one from peg \(A\) to peg \(C\) and it remains to move the \(n-1\) smallest disks from peg \(B\) to peg \(C\) and it can be done in \(T_{n-1}\) moves. In total this strategy requires \(2T_{n-1}+1\) moves. We only have to show that \(2T_{n-1}+1\) moves are necessary. If we follow another strategy, then we must move the largest disk at some point and the \(n-1\) smallest disks must be on a single peg (requiring \(T_{n-1}\) moves). After moving the largest disk we must transfer the \(n-1\) smallest disks to peg \(C\) (requiring another \(T_{n-1}\) moves). It means that \(T_n\geq 2T_{n-1}+1\text{,}\) therefore</p>
\begin{equation*}
T_n=2T_{n-1}+1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
