<p>Three pirates (Anne Bonney, Black Bellamy and Calico Jack) raid a small ship. They take all the treasure they can find, which is seven gold pieces altogether. Afterwards, they would like to distribute the loot among themselves. They only have one rule: since everybody was useful during the raid, everyone should receive at least 1 gold piece. How many ways can they distribute the seven gold pieces? Gold pieces are identical, it does not matter who gets which gold piece. It only matters how many gold pieces each pirate gets.</p>
