<p>In this Section we apply our knowledge on counting to solve the problem of pulling balls out of a urn. In the usual Hungarian lottery, 5 numbers are chosen randomly from 90. That is, there are 90 balls numbered from 1 to 90, and 5 balls are chosen such that none of them will be put back after pulling them out, and in the end the order they have been chosen is not interesting, only what the five numbers are. This problem can have four different versions, depending on whether or not the order of the chosen balls counts, and whether or not we put back a ball into the urn after pulling it out.</p>
