<p>After the previous two exercises, it is not too difficult to find all the possibilities. There are three possibilities corresponding to the distribution where one of them gets all four gold pieces (three possibilities depending on who gets all the gold). If one of them gets three gold pieces, then the remaining one gold piece goes to one of the remaining pirates. There are 6 such possibilities: 3 choices on who gets three gold pieces, and for each choice there are 2 choices on who of the remaining two pirates gets 1 gold piece (and the last pirate does not get any gold pieces). If the highest rewarded pirate gets two gold pieces, then the remaining two gold pieces can be distributed among the two remaining pirates in two different ways: in the first case one of them gets both gold pieces, and the other gets none, in the second case both of the remaining pirates gets one gold piece each. In the first case they have 3 choices on who gets no gold pieces (and the other two pirates get two gold pieces each), in the second case they have 3 choices on who gets two gold pieces (and the other two pirates get one gold piece each). <a knowl="./knowl/tab_4gp3p.html" knowl-id="xref-tab_4gp3p" alt="Table 2.7.7 " title="Table 2.7.7 ">TableÂ 2.7.7</a> summarizes all 15 possibilities for distributing four gold pieces among the three pirates.</p>
