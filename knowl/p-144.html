<p>At the “Freshmen's party” several people meet. Five friends (Arnold, Bill, Carl, David, Edmund) greet each other at this party by shaking hands. How many handshakes does this mean? It is not too hard to count all possibilities: Arnold shakes hand with Bill, Carl, David, Edmund, Bill shakes hand with Carl, David, Edmund (we have already counted the Arnold-Bill handshake), Carl shakes hand with David and Edmund (we have already counted the Arnold-Carl and Bill-Carl handshake), David shakes hand with Edmund (we have already counted all other handshakes with David), and all handshakes with Edmund is already accounted for. That is, there are \(4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10\) handshakes altogether.</p>
