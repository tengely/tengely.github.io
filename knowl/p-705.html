<p>The ratios are very close to a constant, in this case very close to 3 for \(n\in\halmaz{4,5,6,7,8}\text{.}\) At the beginning of this chapter we studied sequences for which the ratio of consecutive elements is a constant, these are geometric progressions. Let us look for geometric progressions satisfying the same recurrence relation as \(a_n\text{.}\) If \(g_n\) is a sequence given by the formula</p>
\begin{equation*}
g_n=rg_{n-1}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
<p>where \(r\) is the common ratio of the sequence with initial value \(g_0\text{,}\) then we have that \(g_n=g_0r^n\text{.}\) That is, \(g_n\) is a geometric progression. Let us assume that for some initial value \(g_0\) and for some \(r\) the progression satisfies the same recurrence relation as \(a_n\text{.}\) Now we obtain</p>
\begin{equation*}
g_n=2g_{n-1}+3g_{n-2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
