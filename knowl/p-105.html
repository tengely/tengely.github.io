<p>If \(d\) is a common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\text{,}\) then \(d\) divides \(r=a-qb\) as well. That is the basic idea of the algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm works as follows. First we apply the Division algorithm for \(a\) and \(b\) to obtain a quotient \(q_1\) and a remainder \(r_1\text{.}\) Then we apply the Division algorithm for \(b\) and \(r_1\) to get a new quotient \(q_2\) and a new remainder \(r_2\text{.}\) We continue, we divide \(r_1\) by \(r_2\) to obtain \(q_3\) and \(r_3\text{.}\) We stop if we obtain a zero remainder. Since the procedure produces a decreasing sequence of non-negative integers so must eventually terminate by descent. The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\text{.}\)</p>
