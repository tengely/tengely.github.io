<p>In one round four couples can dance. How many ways can they form four dancing couples for one round? Assume that each girl chooses a partner in a certain order. First Alice chooses a partner, then Beth, then Carrie, and finally Diane dances with whoever is left. Alice has four choices, because she can choose any of the boys. Beth will only have three choices, because Alice will have already chosen someone. Carrie will have only two choices, because Alice and Beth will have already chosen someone. Finally, Diane has only one choice. Altogether, they have \(4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 24\) possibilities to form four dancing couples at the same time.</p>
