<p>The multiplication of these six factors is carried out by choosing a term from each factor (\(x\) or \(y\)) in every possible way, multiplying these six terms, and then adding the resulting products together. Thus the coefficient of \(x^4y^2\) is the number of possibilities to choose four times the \(x\) and two times the \(y\) out of the six factors. Altogether there are six \(y\)'s to choose from, and we need to choose two of them (and the remaining four factors will be chosen as \(x\)). This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\)-many ways. Therefore the coefficient of \(x^4y^2\) is \(\binom{6}{2} = 15\text{.}\)</p>
