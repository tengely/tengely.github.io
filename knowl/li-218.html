<p><a knowl="./knowl/ex_pascalbinomialsame.html" knowl-id="xref-ex_pascalbinomialsame" alt="Exercise 4.0.4 " title="Exercise 4.0.4 ">Exercise 4.0.4</a> We prove that the two triangles are the same by induction. That is, we prove that the \(k\)th element of the \(n\)th row is the same in both triangles, and we prove this by induction on \(n\text{.}\) For \(n=0\) the two triangles have the same zero row: \(\binom{0}{0} = 1\text{.}\) Assume that the two triangles are equal in the \((n-1)\)st row. We prove that the two triangles contain the same numbers in the \(n\)th row, as well. The first and the last numbers are the same: \(\binom{n}{0} = 1\text{,}\) \(\binom{n}{n} = 1\text{.}\) Now, consider the \(k\)th element of the \(n\)th row for an arbitrary \(1\leq k\leq n-1\text{.}\) In Pascal's triangle it is the sum of the two numbers above it, that is, it is the sum of the \((k-1)\)st and the \(k\)th number of row \((n-1)\text{.}\) By the induction hypotheses, row \(n-1\) is the same in Pascal's triangle and in the triangle of the Binomial coefficients. That is, the \((k-1)\)st element of row \((n-1)\) is \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}\text{,}\) the \(k\)th element of row \((n-1)\) is \(\binom{n-1}{k}\text{.}\) By <a knowl="./knowl/prop_binomsum.html" knowl-id="xref-prop_binomsum" alt="Proposition 4.0.3 " title="Proposition 4.0.3 ">Proposition 4.0.3</a> we have \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}+ \binom{n-1}{k} = \binom{n}{k}\text{.}\) That is, the \(k\)th number of the \(n\)th row in Pascal's triangle is the same as the \(k\)th number of the \(n\)th row in the triangle of the Binomial coefficients. This is true for arbitrary \(1\leq k\leq n-1\text{,}\) thus the \(n\)th row of Pascal's triangle is the same as the \(n\)th row of the triangle of the binomial coefficients. This finishes the induction proof, the two triangles are the same.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-25.html#li-218">in-context</a></span>
