<p>We are interested in how many possible outcomes exist for the Driver's Championship. That is, how many ways can we choose the first 6 cars out of 22 if their order counts? We can try to count the number of possibilities similarly as in <a href="sec_permutations.html" class="xref" alt="Section 2.3 Permutations" title="Section 2.3 Permutations">SectionÂ 2.3</a>, when we counted the number of permutations of some elements. For the first place 22 cars can arrive. No matter which car finishes the race first, there will be 21 possible cars to finish the race second. Then, there will be 20 possible cars to finish the race as the third. Then, there are 19 possibilities for the fourth place, 18 possibilities for the fifth place, and finally, there will remain 17 cars who can finish the race as sixth. Since the order of all the remaining cars does not matter (for the Driver's Championship), the number of possibilities for the first six cars is</p>
\begin{equation*}
22\cdot 21 \cdot 20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18 \cdot 17 = 53~721~360\text{.}
\end{equation*}
