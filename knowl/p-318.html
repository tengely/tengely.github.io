<p>Again, by applying some easy trick we can find the connection between this distribution problem and the first one (where each pirate wanted to get at least one gold piece from the loot). Let us try to reduce this problem to the other one. The only difference is that with the first distribution problem every pirate needed to get at least one gold piece, and now there is no such condition. Let us create a situation where this condition arises naturally! For example, if every pirate puts one gold piece from their own pocket to the treasure chest. Then there would be 7 gold pieces in the treasure chest, but every pirate would want to get at least one gold piece (they would want to get back at least what they put in). This is exactly the same distribution problem as the first was, and thus they must have the same answer, as well.</p>
