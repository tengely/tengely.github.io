<p>In this section we study an important tool to prove mathematical theorems. This tool is called proof by contradiction or indirect proof. There is a simple logic behind, instead of proving that something must be true, we prove it indirectly by showing that it cannot be false. We assume that the opposite of our theorem is true. From this assumption we try to obtain such a conclusion which is known to be false. This contradiction then shows that our theorem must be true.</p>
