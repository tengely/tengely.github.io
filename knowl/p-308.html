<p>Imagine that the pirates put the gold pieces in a line, like this:  Now, they want to divide it into three parts: a leftmost part, a middle part and a rightmost part. The leftmost part will go to Anne Bonney, the middle part is for Black Bellamy, and Calico Jack takes the rightmost part. For example if Anne Bonney gets one gold piece, Black Bellamy gets two gold pieces, and Calico Jack takes four, then they divide the seven gold pieces like this:  That is, they use two sticks to divide the seven gold pieces into three parts. What is left from the first stick is for Anne Bonney, what is between the two sticks is for Black Bellamy, and everything right from the second stick is taken by Calico Jack. Where can they put the sticks? They can put the sticks between gold pieces. They cannot put a stick before the first gold piece, because then Anne Bonney would not get any gold pieces. Similarly, they cannot put a stick after the last gold piece, because Calico Jack needs to receive at least one gold piece. Finally, they cannot put the two sticks between the same two gold pieces, because Black Bellamy needs to get at least one gold piece. Thus, they need to put the two sticks somewhere in the spaces between the gold pieces, but they cannot put the two sticks between the same two gold pieces. That is, they need to find which two places they put sticks to. There are 6 places between the seven gold pieces, and they need to find two, where they put the two sticks. This can be done in \(\binom{6}{2}=\frac{6\cdot 5}{2}=15\)-many ways. This combinatorial argument works in general, when we need to distribute \(k\) gold pieces among \(n\) pirates. In general, \(n\) pirates would need \(n-1\) sticks to divide the gold pieces to \(n\) parts, and there will be \(k-1\) places between \(k\) gold pieces. Thus we obtain</p>
