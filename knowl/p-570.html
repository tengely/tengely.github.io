<p>How can we prove that the two triangles are one and the same? One way to do it would be to prove that they can be generated by the same rule. Pascal's triangle was generated such that every row starts and ends with 1, and every other number is the sum of the two numbers right above it. Considering the \(n\)th row in <a knowl="./knowl/tab_PascalTriangleBinomial.html" knowl-id="xref-tab_PascalTriangleBinomial" alt="Table 4.0.2 " title="Table 4.0.2 ">TableÂ 4.0.2</a>, it starts by \(\binom{n}{0}=1\text{,}\) and it ends with \(\binom{n}{n} = 1\text{.}\) Thus we only need to check whether every other number is the sum of the two numbers above it. The \(k\)th number in the \(n\)th row is \(\binom{n}{k}\) (every row starts with the zeroth number), the two numbers above it are the \((k-1)\)st and \(k\)th of row \(n-1\text{,}\) that is, \(\binom{n-1}{k-1}\) and \(\binom{n-1}{k}\text{.}\) Thus, if we prove that \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}\text{,}\) then the two triangles are indeed the same.</p>
