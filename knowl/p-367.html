<p>Again, this answer is correct if \(k\leq n\text{,}\) otherwise the answer is 0. This is the same problem we discussed in <a href="sec_nchoosek.html" class="xref" alt="Section 2.6 The number of subsets of a given size" title="Section 2.6 The number of subsets of a given size">Section 2.6</a>. Finally, consider the last case: choose \(k\) balls out of \(n\) such that repetition is allowed, and the order does not count. This is the same problem as \(n\) pirates distributing \(k\) gold pieces among themselves (<a href="sec_money.html" class="xref" alt="Section 2.7 Distributing money" title="Section 2.7 Distributing money">Section 2.7</a>). Indeed, for every gold distribution we can consider to choose those balls which have the same number as the pirates who received gold pieces, and exactly as many times as the number of gold pieces they received. Similarly, for every choice of balls we have a distribution: a pirate gets as many gold pieces as the number of times its corresponding ball has been chosen. Thus, by <a knowl="./knowl/thm_pirates.html" knowl-id="xref-thm_pirates" alt="Theorem 2.7.10 " title="Theorem 2.7.10 ">Theorem 2.7.10</a> the number of possibilities to choose \(k\) numbers out of \(n\) if repetition is allowed and the order does not count is</p>
\begin{equation*}
\binom{n+k-1}{n-1} = \binom{n+k-1}{k}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
