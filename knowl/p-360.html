<p>Let us see the four different cases. If the order counts and we allow repetition, then the answer is clearly \(90^5\text{:}\) for each of the five choices we have 90 balls to choose from. (This is the same problem as with the sequences in <a href="sec_sequences.html" class="xref" alt="Section 2.1 Sequences" title="Section 2.1 Sequences">Section 2.1</a>.) If we do not allow repetition (but the order counts), then this is the same problem as with the Formula 1 competition (<a href="sec_orderedsubsets.html" class="xref" alt="Section 2.5 The number of ordered subsets of a given size" title="Section 2.5 The number of ordered subsets of a given size">Section 2.5</a>): for first choice we have 90 balls to choose from, for second choice we have 89 balls to choose from (because we cannot choose what we chose first), for third choice we have 88 balls to choose from (because we cannot choose what we chose first or second), for fourth choice we have 87 balls to choose from (because we cannot choose what we chose first, second or third), finally, for fifth choice we have 86 balls to choose from (because we cannot choose what we chose before). That is, the number of choices we have is</p>
\begin{equation*}
90 \cdot 89 \cdot 88 \cdot 87 \cdot 86 = \frac{90!}{85!} = \frac{90!}{(90-5)!}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
