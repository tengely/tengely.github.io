<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Rather than simply substituting into <a knowl="./knowl/eq_binom.html" knowl-id="xref-eq_binom" alt="Equation 2.6.1 " title="Equation 2.6.1 ">(2.6.1)</a>, we give a combinatorial argument. That is, we give a combinatorial meaning to both sides of the equation, that is, they both will count the same thing. Naturally, if they count the same thing, they must be equal.</p>
<p>The left hand side counts the number of \(k\)-element subsets of an \(n\)-element set. The right hand side counts the number of \((n-k)\)-element subsets of an \(n\)-element set. We prove that there are the same number of \(k\)-element subsets as \((n-k)\)-element subsets. Let \(S\) be an \(n\)-element set, and let us map every \(k\)-element subset into its complementer. This way, we map every \(k\)-element subset to an \((n-k)\)-element subset. Moreover, different \(k\)-element subsets are mapped to different \((n-k)\)-element subsets. Finally, every \((n-k)\)-element subsets is mapped from a \(k\)-element subset (in fact, it is mapped from its complementer). Therefore this map is a one-to-one correspondence between the \(k\)-element subsets and the \((n-k)\)-element subsets.</p>
<p>We can think about this proof in the following way. Choosing \(k\) elements out of \(n\) elements is the same as <em class="emphasis">not choosing</em> \((n-k)\)-elements. That is, deciding which \((n-k)\) elements will not be chosen is the same as deciding which \(k\) elements will be chosen. We can ‘not choose’ \((n-k)\) elements in \(\binom{n}{n-k}\)-many ways, which therefore must be the same as the number of choices to choose \(k\) elements, which is \(\binom{n}{k}\text{.}\)</p></article></body>
