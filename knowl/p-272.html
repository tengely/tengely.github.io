<p>In the Hungarian lottery there are 90 balls in a urn (numbered from 1 to 90). Five numbers of them are chosen in an arbitrary way (usually a celebrity blindly pulls out five balls without putting them back). The order in which the numbers are chosen does not matter, only the chosen numbers themselves (in fact, at the end of the show, the numbers are repeated in their increasing order). People can guess in advance what the five chosen numbers will be, and they can win money depending on how many numbers they managed to guess correctly. The jackpot goes to those, who manage to guess all five numbers properly.</p>
