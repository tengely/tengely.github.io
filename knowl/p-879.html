<p><a knowl="./knowl/contra-1.html" knowl-id="xref-contra-1" alt="Exercise 3.2.4 " title="Exercise 3.2.4 ">ExerciseÂ 3.2.4</a> Assume the opposite, that is, the number \(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}\) is rational. Then there exist \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}=\frac{a}{b}\) for some \(a\in\mathbb{Z}\) and \(b\in\mathbb{N}\) and the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) is 1. Squaring both sides of the equation \(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}=\frac{a}{b}\) we get</p>
\begin{equation*}
2+2\sqrt{6}+3=\frac{a^2}{b^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
<p>That is,</p>
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{6}=\frac{a^2-5b^2}{2b^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
<p>On the right-hand side there is a rational number, so to get a contradiction we have to prove that \(\sqrt{6}\) is irrational. We prove it indirectly. Assume that \(\sqrt{6}\) is rational. Then there exist \(c\) and \(d\) such that \(\sqrt{6}=\frac{c}{d}\) for some \(c\in\mathbb{Z}\) and \(d\in\mathbb{N}\) and the greatest common divisor of \(c\) and \(d\) is 1. We obtain that</p>
\begin{equation*}
6d^2=c^2\text{,}
\end{equation*}
<p>that is, \(c\) is even. Therefore \(c=2c_1\) for some \(c_1\text{.}\) It follows that</p>
\begin{equation*}
6d^2=4c_1^2\Rightarrow 3d^2=2c_1^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
<p>We have that 2 divides \(3d^2\text{.}\) Since 2 does not divide 3 it must divide \(d^2\text{.}\) It means that \(d^2\) is even, so \(d\) is even, a contradiction. We have proved that \(\sqrt{6}\) is irrational and thus we have that \(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}\) is irrational.</p>
