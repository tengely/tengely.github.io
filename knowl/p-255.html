<p>Between 1960 and 2002 only the first six cars (out of 22) finishing the race obtained points. The scoring system had changed a lot during these years, but we concentrate on the fact that some of the drivers obtain points. Moreover, depending on their place they obtain different points. That is, the order of the first six cars matter, but the order of all the other cars do not matter (for the Driver's Championship).</p>
