<p>At first, it might look strange to use digits for the number ten, eleven or twelve. This is actually not so surprising if we think about some historical number systems. Counting months, or looking at the clock we use base 12 numeral system. Until 1971 British people used base 12 for money exchange (12 pennies were worth 1 shilling). Moreover, in the English language eleven and twelve have different names, they are not generated as all the others between 10 and 20, indicating that they may have been distinguished as extra digits.</p>
