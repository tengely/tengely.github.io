<p><a knowl="./knowl/ex_22-6.html" knowl-id="xref-ex_22-6" alt="Exercise 2.5.1 " title="Exercise 2.5.1 ">Exercise 2.5.1</a> can help us to obtain the answer for our question in a different way. Altogether there are \(22!\) possible orders for the 22 cars (this is the number of permutations of 22 cars). But not all of these are considered to be different for the Driver's Championship. In fact, those cases will be considered the same where the first six are the same (and in the same order). Just as we did in <a href="sec_anagrams.html" class="xref" alt="Section 2.4 Anagrams" title="Section 2.4 Anagrams">Section 2.4</a> for counting the anagrams, we can group together those permutations of the 22 cars, which are the same for the Driver's Championship, that is, where the order of the first six cars is the same. We can name every group with the order of the first six cars. Thus, we are interested in the number of groups we have. In one group there are those permutations, where the order of the first six cars is the same, thus they only differ in the last \(22-6 = 16\) cars. There are \(16!\) possible permutations of the last 16 cars, therefore every group contains \(16!\) orderings of the 22 cars. Hence, the number of possibilities (for the Driver's Championship) is</p>
\begin{equation*}
\frac{22!}{(22-6)!} = \frac{22!}{16!} = 22 \cdot 21 \cdot 20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18 \cdot 17 = 53~721~360\text{.}
\end{equation*}
