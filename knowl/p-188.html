<p>In a company the following system is used to record the people working there: in the first record the name of the person is written as a 20 long string with possible spaces. Then the gender of the person is put into the next record (male/female). Then follows the person's job title in a 10 letter long string, and finally comes the payment of the person as an at most 8 digit non-negative integer in base 10. How many people records can be stored in this system if we allow empty names/job titles, as well?</p>
