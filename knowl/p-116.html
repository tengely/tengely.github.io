<p>Assume Robinson had arrived at the island 1st May 1817, and was rescued on 30th April 1850. How would his stones look like, after so much time? He spent 33 years on the island, that is, \(33 \cdot 365 = 12045\) days, not counting leap years. The leap years are 1820, 1824, 1828, 1832, 1836, 1840, 1844, 1848, that is, he spent \(12053\) days altogether on the island. That means one of the ten thousands, two of the thousands, zero of hundreds, five of tens and three of ones. That is, he would have one rock completely full with ten circles, ten boxes in each circle, and ten of the ten lines crossed in each box. Then on his second rock he would have two full circles, and next to them he would have five of the ten crossed lines and three separate lines.</p>
