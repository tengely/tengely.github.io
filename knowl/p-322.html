<p>Finally, our three pirates (Anne Bonney, Black Bellamy and Calico Jack) raid yet another ship. This time, they find a treasure chest containing seven gold pieces. But this time, they did not contribute to obtaining the chest equally. Say, Anne Bonney did not fight with anyone on the ship, while Black Bellamy fought with one person, and Calico Jack fought with two! Therefore, they feel it just that from the seven gold pieces Black Bellamy gets at least one, and Calico Jack gets at least two (they do not impose any condition on how much Anne Bonney needs to get). How many ways can they distribute the gold pieces with these conditions?</p>
