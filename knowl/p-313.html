<p>Here, we received exactly the same number of distributions as for the earlier case, when the three pirates needed to distribute 7 gold pieces, and everybody needed to get at least one. This can hardly be a coincidence. Somehow, we should be able to reduce the new problem to the earlier problem. The main difference is that now every pirate needs to get at least two gold pieces instead of one. This can be easily remedied: everyone takes one gold piece at the very beginning. Then seven gold pieces remain (\(10-3\)), and everyone needs to get at least one more. And this is now exactly the same problem as before. Again, the argument works in general: if there are \(n\) pirates and \(k\) gold pieces, and everybody needs to get at least two gold pieces, then first every pirate takes one gold piece. This way, everyone needs to get one more gold piece, and they will have \(k-n\) gold pieces to distribute further.
