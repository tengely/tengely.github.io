<p>After having found that they have 15 possible ways to distribute seven gold pieces among themselves, the three pirates divide the gold pieces in some way and continue sailing the oceans. Next, they encounter a somewhat bigger ship than last time, and they find a treasure chest with 10 gold pieces in it. All of them needed to do quite a bit of work for getting the treasure chest (lot of sword-fighting for all three of them), therefore this time they want to distribute the money so that everyone receives at least two gold pieces. How many ways can they distribute the money now?</p>
