<p><a knowl="./knowl/ex_anagrams2.html" knowl-id="xref-ex_anagrams2" alt="Exercise 2.4.6 " title="Exercise 2.4.6 ">Exercise 2.4.6</a> <em class="emphasis">First solution.</em> Let us create the (not meaningful) word ‘aaaaabbbbccc’, and consider its anagrams. Put the bouquets into one particular order, and consider an anagram. This anagram represents a distribution of the bouquets among the triplets: if a letter is ‘a’ in the anagram, the corresponding bouquet will be taken by Alice, if a letter is ‘b’ in the anagram, the corresponding bouquet will be taken by Beth, if a letter is ‘c’ in the anagram, the corresponding bouquet will be taken by Carrie. For example, the distribution for the anagram ‘abcbbaaaccba’ is that Alice takes the first, sixth, seventh, eighth and twelfth bouquets, Beth takes the second, fourth, fifth and eleventh bouquets, and Carrie takes the third, ninth and tenth bouquets. This gives a one-to-one correspondence between the possible distributions of the bouquets and the anagrams of ‘aaaaabbbbccc’. Therefore by <a knowl="./knowl/thm_permrepetition.html" knowl-id="xref-thm_permrepetition" alt="Theorem 2.4.4 " title="Theorem 2.4.4 ">Theorem 2.4.4</a> the number of distributions is</p>
\begin{equation*}
\frac{12!}{5! \cdot 4! \cdot 3!} = \frac{479~001~600}{120 \cdot 24 \cdot 6} = 27~720\text{.}
\end{equation*}
<p><em class="emphasis">Second solution.</em> Imagine that the triplets put the 12 bouquets in some order, and then Alice takes the first 5, Beth takes the next four, and Carrie takes the last three. Thus, the original order of the bouquets determine who gets which bouquet. Of course, some of these orders give the same result: if we only permute the first five elements or the next four elements, or the final three elements, then clearly everyone obtains exactly the same bouquets. Thus, the number of possible distributions is the number of permutations of the 12 bouquets, divided by the number of permutations of the first five elements, the number of permutations of the next four elements, the number of permutations of the last three elements. That is, the number of possible distributions is</p>
\begin{equation*}
\frac{12!}{5! \cdot 4! \cdot 3!} = \frac{479~001~600}{120 \cdot 24 \cdot 6} = 27~720\text{.}
\end{equation*}
