<p>Once again, we could try to reduce this new problem to one which we solved already. But this time, we will reduce it to <a knowl="./knowl/thm_piratesgeq0.html" knowl-id="xref-thm_piratesgeq0" alt="Theorem 2.7.8 " title="Theorem 2.7.8 ">Theorem 2.7.8</a> rather than to <a knowl="./knowl/thm_piratesgeq1.html" knowl-id="xref-thm_piratesgeq1" alt="Theorem 2.7.2 " title="Theorem 2.7.2 ">Theorem 2.7.2</a>. Just think about it: it makes more sense to the pirates to just give first the conditional money to the people that deserve it. That is, first they pay the one gold piece to Black Bellamy, and two gold pieces to Calico Jack. Then they will have four gold pieces to distribute among the three of them, which can be done in \(\binom{4+3-1}{3-1} = \binom{6}{2} = 15\)-many ways by <a knowl="./knowl/thm_piratesgeq0.html" knowl-id="xref-thm_piratesgeq0" alt="Theorem 2.7.8 " title="Theorem 2.7.8 ">Theorem 2.7.8</a>.</p>
