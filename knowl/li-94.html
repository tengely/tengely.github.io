<p><a knowl="./knowl/ex_5people3hanshake.html" knowl-id="xref-ex_5people3hanshake" alt="Exercise 2.0.4 " title="Exercise 2.0.4 ">Exercise 2.0.4</a> If everyone shakes hands with three other, then they do not shake hand with exactly one person. It is easier to consider who does not shake hand with whom. The first person does not shake hand with someone. Then of the remaining three people the first does not shake hand with someone from these three. That leaves one person, who does not shake hand with someone else, but everybody else has already been accounted for about not shaking hands with somebody. Thus, it is not possible that each of the five people shake hands with three others. This argument does not work if someone is allowed to shake hands with someone else more than once. Nevertheless, the answer is still <em class="emphasis">no</em>. Use the same argument we used for proving <a knowl="./knowl/cor_handshakes.html" knowl-id="xref-cor_handshakes" alt="Corollary 2.0.3 " title="Corollary 2.0.3 ">Corollary 2.0.3</a>. If we sum up all the handshakes for everyone, we obtain \(5 \cdot 3 = 15\text{,}\) as each of the 5 people shakes hand with 3 others. This way, we counted every handshake twice, thus to obtain the number of handshakes we need to divide it by 2. But \(15/2\) is not an integer, while the number of handshakes should be an integer. This contradiction proves that it is not possible that each of 5 people shakes hand with 3 others. For 7 people we can use this argument, again. If we sum up all the handshakes for everyone, we obtain \(7 \cdot 3 = 21\text{,}\) as each of the 7 people shakes hand with 3 others. This way, we counted every handshake twice, thus to obtain the number of handshakes we need to divide it by 2. But \(21/2\) is not an integer, while the number of handshakes should be an integer. This contradiction proves that it is not possible that each of 7 people shakes hand with 3 others.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-23.html#li-94">in-context</a></span>
