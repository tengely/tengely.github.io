<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Consider \((x+y)^{2n}\text{,}\) and expand it using the Binomial theorem:</p>
\begin{equation*}
(x+y)^{2n} = \sum_{k=0}^{2n} \binom{2n}{k} x^{2n-k} \cdot y^{k}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
<p>Then the right hand side of <a knowl="./knowl/eq_sumsquaresofrow.html" knowl-id="xref-eq_sumsquaresofrow" alt="Equation 4.2.2 " title="Equation 4.2.2 ">(4.2.2)</a> is the coefficient of the term \(x^ny^n\text{.}\) We prove that the left hand side is the coefficient of \(x^ny^n\text{,}\) as well. For this, we compute \((x+y)^{2n}\) by multiplying \((x+y)^n \cdot (x+y)^n\) after expanding both factors using the Binomial theorem:</p>
\begin{equation*}
(x+y)^{2n} = (x+y)^n \cdot (x+y)^n = \left( \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k}y^k \right) \cdot \left( \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k}y^k \right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
<p>Now, let us compute the coefficient of \(x^n y^n\text{.}\) When do we obtain \(x^n y^n\) when we multiply \(\left( \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k}y^k \right)\) by itself? Take for example \(x^n\) from the first factor, this must be multiplied by \(y^n\) from the second factor to obtain \(x^n y^n\text{.}\) The coefficient of \(x^n\) in the first factor is \(\binom{n}{0}\text{,}\) the coefficient of \(y^n\) in the second factor is \(\binom{n}{n}\text{,}\) thus this multiplication contributes by \(\binom{n}{0} \cdot \binom{n}{n}\) to the coefficient of \(x^n y^n\) in \((x+y)^{2n}\text{.}\) Similarly, take the term \(x^{n-1}y\) from the first factor, this must be multiplied by \(xy^{n-1}\) from the second factor to obtain \(x^n y^n\text{.}\) The coefficient of \(x^{n-1}y\) in the first factor is \(\binom{n}{1}\text{,}\) the coefficient of \(xy^{n-1}\) in the second factor is \(\binom{n}{n-1}\text{,}\) thus this multiplication contributes by \(\binom{n}{1} \cdot \binom{n}{n-1}\) to the coefficient of \(x^n y^n\) in \((x+y)^{2n}\text{.}\) In general, for some \(k\) the term \(x^{n-k}y^k\) in the first factor must be multiplied by \(x^k y^{n-k}\) from the second factor. The coefficient of \(x^{n-k}y^k\) in the first factor is \(\binom{n}{k}\text{,}\) the coefficient of \(x^ky^{n-k}\) in the second factor is \(\binom{n}{n-k}\text{,}\) thus this multiplication contributes by \(\binom{n}{k} \cdot \binom{n}{n-k}\) to the coefficient of \(x^n y^n\) in \((x+y)^{2n}\text{.}\) That is, the coefficient of \(x^n y^n\) in \((x+y)^{2n}\) is</p>
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \cdot \binom{n}{n-k}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
<p>Moreover, the coefficient of \(x^ny^n\) in \((x+y)^{2n}\) is \(\binom{2n}{n}\text{,}\) thus the two numbers must be equal. Applying the symmetry of Pascal's triangle (that is, \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\)), we obtain <a knowl="./knowl/eq_sumsquaresofrow.html" knowl-id="xref-eq_sumsquaresofrow" alt="Equation 4.2.2 " title="Equation 4.2.2 ">(4.2.2)</a>:</p>
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2 = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \cdot \binom{n}{n-k} = \binom{2n}{n}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
