<p>The three pirates continued to raid ships. Next time they found a small boat with a fisherman and only four gold pieces. They, again, want to distribute these gold pieces among themselves. But this time they do not want to impose any conditions on the distributions. It may be possible that somebody does not receive any gold pieces, even that somebody takes all the gold. How many ways can they distribute the four gold pieces among themselves?</p>
