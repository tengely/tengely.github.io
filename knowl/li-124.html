<p><a knowl="./knowl/ex_puppy.html" knowl-id="xref-ex_puppy" alt="Exercise 2.4.3 " title="Exercise 2.4.3 ">Exercise 2.4.3</a> Again, let us color the ‘p’s in the anagrams by three colors: red, green, blue. This way, there will be \(5!=120\)-many coloured anagrams of puppy, the same as the number of permutations of five different elements. Now, group together those anagrams, which only differ by their colouring. For example the group ‘puppy’ would contain ‘puppy’, ‘puppy’, ‘puppy’, ‘puppy’, ‘puppy’, ‘puppy’. How do we know that there are six coloured ‘puppy’s? The coloured ‘puppy’s only differ in the colourings of the ‘p’s. The first ‘p’ can be coloured by 3 different colours, the next ‘p’ (right after the ‘u’) can be coloured by two different colours (it cannot be coloured by the same colour as the first ‘p’), then the last ‘p’ should be coloured by the remaining colour. Thus, there are \(3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6\)-many coloured ‘puppy’s. Similarly, there are 6 coloured versions of every anagram. Therefore there are \(\frac{120}{6} = 20\) (uncoloured) anagrams of ‘puppy’. These are ‘pppuy’, ‘pppyu’, ‘ppupy’, ‘ppypu’, ‘ppuyp’, ‘ppyup’, ‘puppy’, ‘pyppu’, ‘pupyp’, ‘pypup’, ‘puypp’, ‘pyupp’, ‘upppy’, ‘ypppu’, ‘uppyp’, ‘yppup’, ‘upypp’, ‘ypupp’, ‘uyppp’, ‘yuppp’.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-23.html#li-124">in-context</a></span>
