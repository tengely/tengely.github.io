<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Suppose that the statement \(S(n)\) is false for some \(n\geq 1\text{.}\) Denote by \(m\) the smallest such value. We have that \(m&gt;1\text{,}\) since by part \((a)\) we know that \(S(1)\) is true. Since \(m\) is as small as possible, \(S(k)\) is true for \(1\leq k \lt m\text{.}\) As a special case we have that \(S(m-1)\) is true. From part \((a)\) and \((b)\) one obtains that the statement is true for \(S(m-1+1)=S(m)\text{.}\) Thus the assumption that \(S(n)\) is false for same \(n\geq 1\) is false.</p></article></body>
