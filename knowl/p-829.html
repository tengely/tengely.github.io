<p><a knowl="./knowl/ex_piratesgeq1.html" knowl-id="xref-ex_piratesgeq1" alt="Exercise 2.7.3 " title="Exercise 2.7.3 ">ExerciseÂ 2.7.3</a> Let the pirates be \(P_1, \dots , P_n\text{.}\) They put the gold pieces in a line. Then they want to divide it into \(n\) parts by putting sticks between gold pieces. The leftmost part will go to \(P_1\text{,}\) the next part from left goes to \(P_2\text{,}\) etc. The rightmost part will go to \(P_n\text{.}\) To this end, they use \(n-1\) sticks to divide the \(k\) gold pieces into \(n\) parts. What is left from the first stick is for \(P_1\text{,}\) what is between the first and second sticks is for \(P_2\text{,}\) etc., and everything right from the last stick is taken by \(P_n\text{.}\) They can put the sticks between gold pieces. They cannot put a stick before the first gold piece, because then \(P_1\) would not get any pieces. Similarly, they cannot put a stick after the last gold piece, because \(P_n\) needs to receive at least one gold piece. Finally, they cannot put two sticks between the same two gold pieces, because then one of the pirates would not get any gold piece. Thus, they need to put \(n-1\) sticks somewhere in the spaces between the gold pieces, but they cannot put two sticks between the same two gold pieces. That is, they need to find which \(n-1\) places they put sticks to. There are \(k-1\) places between \(k\) gold pieces, and they need to find \(n-1\text{,}\) where they put the \(n-1\) sticks. This can be done in \(\binom{k-1}{n-1}\)-many ways.</p>
