<p>Let us consider counting. Imagine Robinson Crusoe spending his days on an uninhabited island, and he counts all the days by carving a vertical line every day into a rock. He was raised using the base 10 numbers, thus after reaching 9 lines, he crosses them on the tenth day (thus marking them as ten). That way he groups together every ten days. Then, when he reaches ten of such groups, then he carves a big box around them. That is how he indicates hundreds. Then he circles around every ten boxes, indicating thousands, etc. Then, reaching ten circles on one rock he would look for a new rock to carve days into.</p>
