<p>It is possible to define a distance between them. One considers the 13 same-suit cards arranged in a circle from \(A\) to \(K\) going clockwise. Given \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) one defines the distance \(d(C_1,C_2)\) as the clockwise distance from \(C_1\) to \(C_2\text{.}\) The second observation is that either \(d(C_1,C_2)\leq 6\) or \(d(C_2,C_1)\leq 6\text{.}\) This statement can be proved indirectly. Assume that \(d(C_1,C_2)&gt;6\) and \(d(C_2,C_1)&gt;6\text{.}\) Then there must be at least 14 cards having the same suit, a contradiction. Let us consider an example. If the two cards are \(C_1=3\) and \(C_2=J\text{,}\) then we have that \(d(3,J)=8\) and \(d(J,3)=5\text{.}\) This fact is used to decide which card is going to be at the top of the pile. Assume that \(d(C_i,C_j)\leq 6\text{.}\) The assistant will place card \(C_i\) at the top of the pile and \(C_j\) will be the hidden card. The assistant still has to decide how to order the remaining 3 cards. Here comes a tiny combinatorics involved, three cards can be ordered in \(3!=6\) different ways. That is, somehow the assistant will be able to encode the distance \(d(C_i,C_j)\leq 6\text{.}\) The 52 cards are ordered following the rules:</p>
