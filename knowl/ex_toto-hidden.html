<body><article class="exercise-like"><p>In Hungary there is a game called “TOTÓ”, where one bets on the outcome of certain football games. There are \(13+1\) games one can bet on, and there are 3 choices for each of them: one writes ‘1’ if they think that the first team wins, one writes ‘2’ if they think that the second team wins, and ‘X’ means that the result is a draw. How many TOTÓ tickets should be filled out to make sure that one of them will be correct for all \(13+1\) games?</p></article></body>
