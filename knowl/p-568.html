<p>Let us create a triangle from numbers in the following way. Let us write 1 to the top. This we call row zero of the triangle. Then every row of the triangle contains one more numbers than the row before, aligned in a way that every number is lower left and/or lower right from the numbers in the row above. We start and end every row by 1, and in between we write numbers which are the sums of the two numbers above them, that is, we write the sum of the upper left and upper right numbers. Thus in the first row (right below the top 1) we write 1 to lower left and to lower right of this number. Then in the second row we write 1, 2, 1, such that 2 is in between the two 1's of the first row. In the third row, we write 1, 3, 3, 1, etc. (see <a knowl="./knowl/tab_PascalTriangle.html" knowl-id="xref-tab_PascalTriangle" alt="Table 4.0.1 " title="Table 4.0.1 ">Table 4.0.1</a>). This way, one can easily compute the numbers occurring in the triangle row after row. This triangle is called Pascal's triangle, named after the French polymath Blaise Pascal (1623–1662).</p>
