<p>One way to solve this problem is of course to write down all possible distributions. Let us list the possibilities by considering the amount of gold pieces received by the highest rewarded pirate. If everyone needs to get at least one gold piece, then nobody can have more than five gold pieces. In fact, if somebody gets five gold pieces, then the other two will have two gold pieces to distribute, which they can only do by giving one gold piece to each of them. This is three possibilities (depending on who receives the five gold pieces). If the pirate in the highest regard gets four gold pieces, then the other two pirates will have three gold pieces to distribute. They can only distribute it as two-one. This altogether amounts to 6 possibilities: 3 possibilities on who gets four gold pieces, then in each case 2 possibilities on who gets two gold pieces, that is, \(3 \cdot 2\) possibilities. (Note that this is the number of permutations of the three pirates.) Finally, if the highest reward is three gold pieces, then the other two pirates can distribute the remaining four gold pieces in two different ways: either one of them gets three gold pieces, and the other gets one, or both get two gold pieces. Both distributions amount to 3 possibilities altogether. In the first case there are 3 possibilities to choose who gets one gold piece (and the other two gets three gold pieces each). In the second case there are 3 possibilities to choose who gets three gold pieces (and the other two gets two gold pieces each). <a knowl="./knowl/tab_7gp3p.html" knowl-id="xref-tab_7gp3p" alt="Table 2.7.1 " title="Table 2.7.1 ">TableÂ 2.7.1</a> summarizes the 15 possible distributions.</p>
