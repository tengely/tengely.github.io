<p>Now, let us count the number of anagrams of ‘eye’. There are only three of them: ‘eye’, ‘eey’, ‘yee’. Unfortunately, exactly the same argument as before does not work in this case. The complications arise because of the two e's: that is, those two letters are the same. We could easily solve the problem if the two e's would be different. Thus let us make them look different. Let us colour one of the e's by blue, the other e by red, and consider all <em class="emphasis">coloured anagrams</em>. Now, every letter is different, and the former argument works: there are \(3\cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6\) coloured anagrams. Nevertheless, we are interested in the number of anagrams, no matter their colour. Therefore we group together those anagrams, which represent the same word, only they are coloured differently (see <a knowl="./knowl/fig_eye.html" knowl-id="xref-fig_eye" alt="Figure 2.4.2 " title="Figure 2.4.2 ">Figure 2.4.2</a>).</p>
