<p><a knowl="./knowl/contra-2.html" knowl-id="xref-contra-2" alt="Exercise 3.2.5 " title="Exercise 3.2.5 ">ExerciseÂ 3.2.5</a> Suppose the opposite of the statement, that is, there exists \(x=\frac{p}{q}\) with \(p\in\mathbb{Z},q\in\mathbb{N}\) and \(\gcd(p,q)=1\) such that</p>
\begin{equation*}
a\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^2+b\frac{p}{q}+c=0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
<p>Multiply the equation by \(q^2\) to obtain (we note that \(q\neq 0\))</p>
\begin{equation*}
ap^2+bpq+cq^2=0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
<p>Assume that \(p\) is even and \(q\) is odd. In this case \(ap^2\) is even, \(bpq\) is even and \(cq^2\) is odd. Hence \(ap^2+bpq+cq^2\) is odd, a contradiction. Now assume that \(p\) is odd and \(q\) is even. Here we obtain that \(ap^2\) is odd, \(bpq\) is even and \(cq^2\) is even. Again we get a contradiction. Finally, assume that \(p\) is odd and \(q\) is odd. We get that \(ap^2\) is odd, \(bpq\) is odd and \(cq^2\) is odd, so \(ap^2+bpq+cq^2\) is odd, a contradiction. We remark that the case \(p\) is even, \(q\) is even is not possible since \(\gcd(p,q)=1\text{.}\) The statement follows.</p>
