<p>Again, we can solve this problem by writing down all possible distributions, like before. As before, let us list the possibilities by considering the amount of gold pieces received by the highest rewarded pirate. If everyone needs to get at least two gold pieces, then nobody can have more than six gold pieces. In fact, if somebody gets six gold pieces, then the other two will have four gold pieces to distribute, which they can only do by giving two gold pieces to each of them. This is three possibilities (depending on who receives the six gold pieces). If the pirate in the highest regard gets five gold pieces, then the other two pirates will have five gold pieces to distribute. They can only distribute it as three-two. This altogether amounts to 6 possibilities: 3 possibilities on who gets five gold pieces, then in each case 2 possibilities on who gets three gold pieces, that is, \(3 \cdot 2\) possibilities. Finally, if the highest reward is four gold pieces, then the other two pirates can distribute the remaining six gold pieces in two different ways: either one of them gets four gold pieces, and the other gets two, or both get three gold pieces. Both distributions amounts to 3 possibilities altogether. In the first case there are 3 possibilities to choose who gets two gold pieces (and the other two gets four gold pieces each). In the second case there are 3 possibilities to choose who gets four gold pieces (and the other two gets three gold pieces each). <a knowl="./knowl/tab_10gp3p.html" knowl-id="xref-tab_10gp3p" alt="Table 2.7.4 " title="Table 2.7.4 ">TableÂ 2.7.4</a> summarizes the 15 possible distributions.</p>
