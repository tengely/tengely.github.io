<p>We make two remarks here. First, rather than reducing the problem again for the first pirate situation (where everybody gets at least one gold piece), we reduced it to one, which is easier to use. This is quite customary in Mathematics, that when we have proved a hard result, we simply use it for similar situations, rather than trying to figure out a similar proof for each similar case. Second, that the proof works even in the case where some of the \(k_i\)s are negative. That would represent to a situation where the \(i\)th pirate was so lazy, that he actually hindered the raid, and therefore he should pay some amount into the loot they obtained.</p>
